## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js installed on your system.
- A package manager: either pnpm, npm, yarn, or bun.
- A Twilio account with WhatsApp sandbox configured.

## Installation

Choose your preferred package manager for installing dependencies:

### Using pnpm

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Using npm

```bash
npm install
```

### Using Yarn

```bash
yarn

## Setting Up Twilio WhatsApp Sandbox

1. Join the sandbox following this link: [Twilio WhatsApp Sandbox](https://console.twilio.com/us1/develop/sms/try-it-out/whatsapp-learn).
2. Use your real WhatsApp number as this number will be used as the "to" in the message creation.

## Configuring Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file at the root of your project and write your Twilio credentials and phone numbers in it:

```env
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=<Your Twilio Account SID>
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=<Your Twilio Auth Token>
TO_NUMBER="whatsapp:<Your WhatsApp Number>"
FROM_NUMBER="whatsapp:<Your Twilio WhatsApp Number>"
```

You can find these values through the links in the Useful Links section below.

## Running the Script

Run the script using your package manager. Here's how you can do it with pnpm, but you can use any package manager:

```bash
pnpm run send
```
